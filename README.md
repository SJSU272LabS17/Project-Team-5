Idea# 1: VoteChain

Problem: 

Today’s elections can be manipulated and voters can be coerced to vote against their will. Many a times, the credibility of the election process itself is questionable. In such a scenario, we need an election process that is transparent, fair, inexpensive and convenient. No singular protocol for managing votes. Voting equipment varies across jurisdiction. Several different voting systems are commonly employed, including paper ballots, Directly Recording Electronic (DRE) systems and Electronically operated vote counting machines (EVMs). Punch card voting systems are also used, as well as ballot marking devices to assist disabled voters. In addition to votes being cast in a multitude of way, that information is also recorded and stored non-uniformly. Paper ballots are typically scanned into a computer system, either at the polling place or a centralized location for that jurisdiction. DRE systems store vote information in the machine’s hard drive and some systems have the capacity to generate a paper audit trail, but not all jurisdictions maintain an audit trail. 

Also, sellers and producers of electronic voting machines were legally not obligated to notify anyone about problems cropping up in regards to their machines. Similarly, there exists no resource for public officials to learn about potential problems with their voting machines ahead of time

Solution:

The solution explores the current security shortcomings of the voting system, as well as the feasibility of an online voting system implemented using blockchain technology. Despite security risks and concerns, block-chain data storage in combination with electronic voting is a progressive and secure option for our voting systems. Blockchain technology makes it possible to attain a highly credible and verifiable election process at an inexpensive cost.

Idea# 2: B(PA)WARE

Bisphenol-A also called as BPA is a toxic chemical component present in polycarbonate plastic used in the manufacturing of certain beverage containers and liners of canned food items. BPA-based containers have BPA-based liners which prevents the contents of the can from reacting with the can surface, hence preventing corrosion and leaching of can materials into food. But why is BPA toxic? It can mimic our hormones and disrupt the endocrine system which is the sole controller of functions of the body from a cellular level. Continuous and high level exposure to BPA can lead to altered immune system, structural brain damage and causes reproductive problems. In 2008, usage of BPA in the manufacturing of products made from polycarbonate plastic became a matter of serious concern which fueled FDA experts to conduct over 300 studies analyzing various consumer products and its conclusion helped to ban the use of BPA in baby bottles, sippy cups and other toddler items. But there are still many products out in the consumer world as stated above containing toxic chemicals, prolonged exposure to which can cause serious health problems. So being aware of the daily-use products and its contents has become inevitable to maintain a long lasting healthy body functionality.

B(P)AWARE is a mobile application that provides instant information about a product’s BPA content or toxicity content by just scanning the barcode of a product. Since barcode is universally present in every product that enters the consumer world, the application uses it as an identifier to get the product’s information from the database. This aids consumer to become aware of products containing toxic substances, so, people will just be a scan away from being BPA aware. The application will also suggest products that are BPA free or new arrivals in the market as a substitute to the products containing BPA.
