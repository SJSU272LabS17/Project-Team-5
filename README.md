Idea 1 : VoteChain
Problem: 
Today’s elections can be manipulated and voters can be coerced to vote against their will. Many a times, the credibility of the election process itself is questionable. In such a scenario, we need an election process that is transparent, fair, inexpensive and convenient. No singular protocol for managing votes. Voting equipment varies across jurisdiction. Several different voting systems are commonly employed, including paper ballots, Directly Recording Electronic (DRE) systems and Electronically operated vote counting machines (EVMs). Punch card voting systems are also used, as well as ballot marking devices to assist disabled voters. In addition to votes being cast in a multitude of way, that information is also recorded and stored non-uniformly. Paper ballots are typically scanned into a computer system, either at the polling place or a centralized location for that jurisdiction. DRE systems store vote information in the machine’s hard drive and some systems have the capacity to generate a paper audit trail, but not all jurisdictions maintain an audit trail. 

Also, sellers and producers of electronic voting machines were legally not obligated to notify anyone about problems cropping up in regards to their machines. Similarly, there exists no resource for public officials to learn about potential problems with their voting machines ahead of time

Solution:
The solution explores the current security shortcomings of the voting system, as well as the feasibility of an online voting system implemented using blockchain technology. Despite security risks and concerns, block-chain data storage in combination with electronic voting is a progressive and secure option for our voting systems. Blockchain technology makes it possible to attain a highly credible and verifiable election process at an inexpensive cost.
